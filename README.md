# Chess

Prerequisites
python-chess: a pure Python chess library

The command 'python main.py' will run the model in test, train and pretrain modes. For a description of the options, run 'python main.py -h.'

In order to pretrain the model, games in pgn format must be copied into a subdirectory 'data' of the root folder.
